				<h3>Revised the 'INFO' page.</h3>
				<small>Post by T.J. on 6/6/2023 at 6:46 PM</small>
				<p>Very funny that I ended up actually having a use for that forth page, huh?</p>
				<p>Anyway, still kinda sucks to have to write these manually, but I suppose it keeps my HTML syntax close to the brain so nbd in the long run. This page is gonna look REALLY funny eventually though if I don't add some kind of history feature or like. Actually move these to a database or you know. Something actually professional. Haha. Whatever. I already took my LinkedIn off of this thing because I hate that site so. Who even cares! But yeah guess I gotta make this place look slightly less awful now so. =))))))))))))</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlySwdxfZw">Do you know why I hate Undertale? Because it's the best game ever made. The graphics look like they were drawn by a 4 year-old, with the talents of Pablo Picasso in his PRIME... which is would've said if I liked the graphics; which I do... NOT. Narratively, this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling, every choice you make weighs on your conscious because every connection you make with the characters feels organic. And that's why i'm giving this game a 5 out of 5... billion, it SUCKS-</a></p>

				<p>Is that a cut on your face, or part of your eye?</p>
				<p>The gash weaves down as if you cry.</p>
				<p>The pain itself is reason why.</p>
