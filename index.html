Brief Overview: I created a page for GUI 1. I added some features I thought were neat and tried to make the page look nice. It doesn't really serve much of a purpose at the moment besides giving some very rough information on me, but it gives some bare bones stuff, and I plan to clean it up more eventually.

				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlySwdxfZw">Do you know why I hate Undertale? Because it's the best game ever made. The graphics look like they were drawn by a 4 year-old, with the talents of Pablo Picasso in his PRIME... which is would've said if I liked the graphics; which I do... NOT. Narratively, this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling, every choice you make weighs on your conscious because every connection you make with the characters feels organic. And that's why i'm giving this game a 5 out of 5... billion, it SUCKS-</a></p>

				<p>The pain itself is reason why.</p>
