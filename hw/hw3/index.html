Brief Overview: here's is my very scuffed multiplcation table program. i do not know if i actually met all the requirements but the requirements are vague and i WOULD ask about them but the thing is due in an hour and my father has been in and out of the hospital for the past week so i hope you are understanding if this is not up to scuff. i am also exhausted right now. i am turning this in as is. im 99% sure it meets standards. even if it is a bit ugly. but like. it's math. i think these sorts of semi-ugly pages are fitting for things like this.
